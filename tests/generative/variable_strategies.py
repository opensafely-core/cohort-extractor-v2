# Here follows a set of recursive strategies for constructing valid query model graphs.
#
# There is a set of strategies corresponding to the abstract types in the query model (for example `frame` or
# `one_row_per_patient_series`), each of which returns one of the direct subtypes of that type (both abstract and
# concrete). Another set of strategies corresponds to the concrete types in the query model (for example `filter` or
# `select_column`), each of which constructs the corresponding node and recursively invokes other strategies to
# provide the constructor arguments (using the strategy corresponding to the types of the arguments).
#
# So each concrete node type appears in two places: in its own strategy and in the strategy of its immediate
# supertype. And each abstract type appears in its own strategy, in the strategy of its immediate supertype and in
# the strategies of any concrete nodes which have a constructor argument of that abstract type.
#
# When we invoke the strategy of an abstract type, it tugs at a thread that runs down through the type hierarchy
# (picking a random subclass at each level) until it reaches a concrete type which can be constructed. (And it then
# does the same for all of the necessary constructor arguments.)
#
# The strategies are ordered in this file in the same order that the corresponding classes are defined in
# `query_model`, to make it easier to see the correspondence and to spot errors.
#
# There are, you will be astonished to learn, a few complications.
#
# * In order to help Hypothesis shrink the examples, the subclasses of each abstract type are ordered roughly by
#   "simplicity", using the number of child nodes as a heuristic. It's hard to follow even that, though, because of
#   the way the concrete types are grouped. And, partly as a consequence, this strategy doesn't shrink very well.
# * We need to use `st.deferred` in some places to allow (transitively) mutually recursive strategies. We're using it
#   in _all_ the abstract type strategies in order to allow us to keep the ordering the same as that of the definitions
#   in `query_model`.
# * The query model type hierarchy doesn't give us all the information we need, so the approach outlined above will
#   generate invalid query model graphs (due either to the domains or the types being incorrect). We handle this by
#   constructing the query model objects using a special-purpose strategy `qm_builds`, which can discard invalid
#   instances. There is an unexplored optimization avenue here: make the strategies more specific to include type
#   and/or domain, so that we don't discard so many examples.

# SQlAlchemy does a certain amount of interpretation and optimization client-side. In particular in some cases where it
# can statically determine that the result of a function is constant, it replaces that function with the constant
# value. In extreme cases this may mean that the result of an entire query is completely determined client-side. In
# those cases our engine cannot determine the population for the dataset because it draws the patient universe from all
# tables used by the query -- and the query will use no tables.
#
# So we need to exclude such queries. This function detects function calls that SQLAlchemy will optimize away so that
# can avoid queries made up entirely of such things.
#
# Note that it is not sufficient to check that there is at least one non-trivial node in the tree because the collapse
# of trivial nodes lower down the tree can cause those higher up to become collapsible. For example this query reduces
# to `False`:
#
#     Function.And(
#         lhs=SelectColumn(
#             source=SelectPatientTable(name="p0"),
#             name="b1",
#         ),
#         rhs=Function.IsNull(source=Value(value=0)),
#     )
#
# The only way to detect cases like that would be to replicate SQLAlchemy's interpretation of the entire tree in order
# to check that the query is non-trivial.
#
# We therefore exclude all trivial nodes from the query. That means that there are realistic queries with trivial
# subtrees that we can't generate with these strategies. We could consider composing known-non-trivial subtrees with
# possibly-trivial subtrees as a future improvement to these strategies.
#
# And advantage to this approach is that we reject huge numbers of trivial queries that Hypothesis was otherwise
# inclined to generate, so the queries generally are rather more realistic.
