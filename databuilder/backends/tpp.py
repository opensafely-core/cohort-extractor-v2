    Right trim arbitrary characters.

    MSSQL's {L,R}TRIM() functions (unlike TRIM()) don't allow trimming of
    arbitrary characters, only spaces. So we've implemented it here. Note that
    this won't work as-is for '^' or ']', but they could be supported with a
    bit of escaping.

      * Since we're using PATINDEX(), which only works from the front of the
        string, we REVERSE() the string every time we refer to it and then
        re-REVERSE() the result once we're done.
      * We search through the string to find the index of the first character
        that isn't the thing we're stripping.
      * Then we work out the length of the string remaining from that point to
        the end.
      * Finally we take a substring from the index to the end of the string.

    (LTRIM() could be implemented in the same way, but without all the reversing.)
