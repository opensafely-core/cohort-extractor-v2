    Split a flat iterator of items into a nested iterator of groups of items. Groups are
    delineated by the presence of a sentinel `separator` value which marks the start of
    each group.

    For example, the iterator:

        - SEPARATOR
        - 1
        - 2
        - SEPARATOR
        - 3

          - 2
        -
          - 3
          - 4

    representing the data but the flat iterator is much easier to generate correctly.
