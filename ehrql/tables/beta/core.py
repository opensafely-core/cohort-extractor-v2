    ### Representativeness

    You can find out more about the representativeness of these data in the
    OpenSAFELY-TPP backend in:

    > The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, Colm D. Andrews, Anna Schultze, Helen J. Curtis, William J. Hulme, John Tazare, Stephen J. W. Evans, _et al._ 2022.
    > "OpenSAFELY: Representativeness of Electronic Health Record Platform OpenSAFELY-TPP Data Compared to the Population of England."

    > <https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.18010.1>


    ### Orphan records

    If a practice becomes aware that a patient has moved house,
    then the practice _deducts_, or removes, the patient's records from their register.
    If the patient doesn't register with a new practice within a given amount of time
    (normally from four to eight weeks),
    then the patient's records are permanently deducted and are _orphan records_.
    There are roughly 1.6 million orphan records.

    ### Recording of death in primary care

    In England, it is the statutory duty of the doctor who had attended in the last
    illness to complete a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). ONS death data
    are considered the gold standard for identifying patient deaths because they are
    based on these MCCDs.

    There is generally a lag between the death being recorded in ONS data and it
    appearing in the primary care record, but the coverage or recorded death is almost
    complete and the date of death date is usually reliable when it appears. There is
    also a lag in ONS death recording (see [below](https://docs.opensafely.org/ehrql/reference/schemas/beta.core/#ons_deaths)
    for more detail). You can find out more about the accuracy of date of death
    recording in primary care in:

    > Gallagher, A. M., Dedman, D., Padmanabhan, S., Leufkens, H. G. M. & de Vries, F 2019. The accuracy of date of death recording in the Clinical
    > Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in England compared with the Office for National Statistics death registrations.
    > Pharmacoepidemiol. Drug Saf. 28, 563â€“569.
    > <https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4747>

    By contrast, cause of death is often not accurate in the primary care record so we
    don't make it available to query here.

    Registered deaths

    Date and cause of death based on information recorded when deaths are
    certified and registered in England and Wales from February 2019 onwards.
    The data provider is the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
    This table is updated approximately weekly in OpenSAFELY.

    This table includes the underlying cause of death and up to 15 medical conditions mentioned on the death certificate.
    These codes (`cause_of_death_01` to `cause_of_death_15`) are not ordered meaningfully.

    More information about this table can be found in following documents provided by the ONS:

    - [Information collected at death registration](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#information-collected-at-death-registration)
    - [User guide to mortality statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017)
    - [How death registrations are recorded and stored by ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/howdeathregistrationsarerecordedandstoredbyons)

    In the associated database table [ONS_Deaths](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/#ONS_Deaths),
    a small number of patients have multiple registered deaths.
    This table contains the earliest registered death.
    The `ehrql.tables.beta.raw.ons_deaths` table contains all registered deaths.

    !!! warning
        There is also a in ONS death recording caused amongst other things by things like autopsies and inquests delaying
        reporting on cause of death. This is evident in the [OpenSAFELY historical database coverage report](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-history/#ons_deaths)
