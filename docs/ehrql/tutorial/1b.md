# ehrQL tutorial: Another minimal dataset definition

## Example dataset definition 1b: Adding an extra output column from a minimal data source

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

* retrieve additional data columns
* explain what is involved in creating a `Dataset`

### Full Example

We will start with a similar dataset definition that we used in the previous example
with the addition of an extra output column, for sex.

???+ example "Dataset definition: `1b_minimal_dataset_definition.py`"

    ```python
    ---8<-- "ehrql-tutorial-examples/1b_minimal_dataset_definition.py"
    ```

If we run this against the sample data provided, it will pick out only patients who were born in 2000 or later, and will also provide information about sex as a new column.

???+ example "Data table: `minimal/patients.csv`"

    {{ read_csv('ehrql-tutorial-examples/example-data/minimal/patients.csv') }}

In this case, we see patient 2, 5 and 7.

???+ example "Output dataset: `outputs/1b_minimal_dataset_definition.csv`"

    {{ read_csv('ehrql-tutorial-examples/outputs/1b_minimal_dataset_definition.csv') }}

## Line by line explanation

### Addition of Sex

Only the last line is new.

!!! info
    In Python code, like in many other languages, the dot operator, `.`, appears frequently.

    Generally, `.` is used when you want to access something "belonging" to a value.
    That "something" is typically either a data attribute,
    or a method (a function).
    Methods will have brackets, and may accept arguments.
    Attributes will not have brackets.

`sex` is a data attribute that is available on the `patient` table
and can be thought of as corresponding to the `sex` column.

Here, we can simply look at the raw data tables to see the available columns.
For real OpenSAFELY data tables, this is not possible,
but you can use the schema documentation to discover which columns are available.

## Your turn

Run the dataset definition by:

```
opensafely exec ehrql:v0 generate-dataset "1b_minimal_dataset_definition.py" --dummy-tables "example-data/minimal/" --output "outputs.csv"
```

or if you are using `project.yaml`:

```
opensafely run extract_1b_minimal_population
```

!!! question

    Can you modify the dataset definition so that the output shows:

    1. Both `date_of_birth` and `sex` columns?
    2. `year_of_birth` instead of `date_of_birth`?
