# ehrQL tutorial Part 1: Minimal dataset definition
By the end of this tutorial, you should able:

* to write a very simple dataset definition
* to run that dataset definition with Data Builder

## Full Example

For all of our examples in this series of tutorials,
we will start by showing the full dataset definition
and then explain it line by line.

In this first tutorial,
we will start with a minimal dataset definition.
This finds the patients whose year of birth is 2000 or later.

???+ example "Dataset definition: `1a_minimal_dataset_definition.py`"

    ```python
    ---8<-- "ehrql-tutorial-examples/1a_minimal_dataset_definition.py"
    ```

If we run this against the sample data provided (see below), it will
pick out only patients who were born in 2000 or later.

???+ example "Original Data: `minimal/patients.csv`"

    {{ read_csv('ehrql-tutorial-examples/example-data/minimal/patients.csv') }}

In this case, patient 2, 5 and 7.

???+ example "Output dataset: `outputs/1a_minimal_dataset_definition.csv`"

    {{ read_csv('ehrql-tutorial-examples/outputs/1a_minimal_dataset_definition.csv') }}

## Line by line explanation

### Import statements

Lines of the format `from… import…` specify which of Data Builder's code and features
to use in our dataset definition.
Here, we import two components of Data Builder:

* `Dataset` as provided by the query language, to create a dataset
* the `patients` table, which is one of several data tables that ehrQL gives access to

### Create a `Dataset`

A valid dataset definition must contain a dataset assigned to the name `dataset`. Like many other programming languages, we use `=` to assign a value to a variable name. In this case, we have assigned `Dataset()` to the variable `dataset`. This creates an empty dataset.
In subsequent steps,
we specify the data from the available data tables
that we wish to add to the dataset.

### Find year of birth
Next we define a year of birth. `date_of_birth` is in the patient table and therefore we can assign it to this new variable. We want to only capture the `year` of birth so we add the `.year` to the end of this variable assignment.

### Set population
Finally we set the population of the dataset. We use the special method called `set_population()` and pass in the definition of the population. In this case, we want to use our previously created `year_of_birth` and say, if year of birth is equal to or greater than 2000, include in this dataset.

## Your turn
Run the dataset definition by:

```
opensafely exec databuilder:v0 generate-dataset "1a_minimal_dataset_definition.py" --dummy-tables "example-data/minimal/" --output "outputs.csv"
```

or if you are using `project.yaml`:

```
opensafely run extract_1a_minimal_population
```

!!! question

    Can you modify the dataset definition so that the output shows:

    1. Patients that were born before 1980?
    2. Patient that were born between 1980 and 2000?
