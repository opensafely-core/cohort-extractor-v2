# <strong>beta.emis</strong> schema

Available on backends: [**EMIS**](../../backends#emis)

This schema defines the data (both primary care and externally linked) available in the
OpenSAFELY-EMIS backend. For more information about this backend, see
"[EMIS Primary Care](https://docs.opensafely.org/data-sources/emis/)".

``` {.python .copy title='To use this schema in an ehrQL file:'}
from ehrql.tables.beta.emis import (
    clinical_events,
    medications,
    patients,
)
```

<p class="dimension-indicator"><code>many rows per patient</code></p>
## clinical_events

Each record corresponds to a single clinical or consultation event for a patient.

Note that event codes do not change in this table. If an event code in the coding
system becomes inactive, the event will still be coded to the inactive code.
As such, codelists should include all relevant inactive codes.

## medications

The medication table provides data about prescribed medications in primary care.

Prescribing data, including the contents of the medications table are standardised
across clinical information systems such as SystmOne (TPP). This is a requirement
for data transfer through the
[Electronic Prescription Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/)
in which data passes from the prescriber to the pharmacy for dispensing.

Medications are coded using
[dm+d codes](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2019/08/what-is-the-dm-d-the-nhs-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices/).
The medications table is structured similarly to the [clinical_events](#clinical_events)
table, and each row in the table is made up of a patient identifier, an event (dm+d)
code, and an event date. For this table, the event refers to the issue of a medication
(coded as a dm+d code), and the event date, the date the prescription was issued.

### Factors to consider when using medications data

Depending on the specific area of research, you may wish to exclude medications
in particular periods. For example, in order to ensure medication data is stable
following a change of practice, you may want to exclude patients for a period after
the start of their practice registration . You may also want to
exclude medications for patients for a period prior to their leaving a practice.
Alternatively, for research looking at a specific period of
interest, you may simply want to ensure that all included patients were registered
at a single practice for a minimum time prior to the study period, and were
registered at the same practice for the duration of the study period.

Examples of using ehrQL to calculation such periods can be found in the documentation
on how to
[use ehrQL to answer specifc questions](../../../how-to/examples#excluding-medications-for-patients-who-have-transferred-between-practices).

### Representativeness

You can find out more about the representativeness of these data in the
OpenSAFELY-TPP backend in:

> The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, Colm D. Andrews, Anna Schultze, Helen J. Curtis, William J. Hulme, John Tazare, Stephen J. W. Evans, _et al._ 2022.
> "OpenSAFELY: Representativeness of Electronic Health Record Platform OpenSAFELY-TPP Data Compared to the Population of England."
> Wellcome Open Res 2022, 7:191.
> <https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.18010.1>


### Orphan records

If a practice becomes aware that a patient has moved house,
then the practice _deducts_, or removes, the patient's records from their register.
If the patient doesn't register with a new practice within a given amount of time
(normally from four to eight weeks),
then the patient's records are permanently deducted and are _orphan records_.
There are roughly 1.6 million orphan records.

### Recording of death in primary care

In England, it is the statutory duty of the doctor who had attended in the last
illness to complete a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD). ONS death data
are considered the gold standard for identifying patient deaths because they are
based on these MCCDs.

There is generally a lag between the death being recorded in ONS data and it
appearing in the primary care record, but the coverage or recorded death is almost
complete and the date of death is usually reliable when it appears. There is
also a lag in ONS death recording (see [`ons_deaths`](/reference/schemas/beta.core/#ons_deaths) below
for more detail). You can find out more about the accuracy of date of death
recording in primary care in:

> Gallagher, A. M., Dedman, D., Padmanabhan, S., Leufkens, H. G. M. & de Vries, F 2019. The accuracy of date of death recording in the Clinical
> Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in England compared with the Office for National Statistics death registrations.
> Pharmacoepidemiol. Drug Saf. 28, 563â€“569.
> <https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.4747>

By contrast, cause of death is often not accurate in the primary care record so we
don't make it available to query here.
