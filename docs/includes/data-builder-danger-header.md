    This page discusses the new [OpenSAFELY Data
    Builder](https://github.com/opensafely-core/databuilder) for
    accessing OpenSAFELY data sources.

    **Use OpenSAFELY [cohort-extractor](https://github.com/opensafely-core/cohort-extractor), unless you are
    specifically involved in the development or testing of Data
    Builder.**

    OpenSAFELY Data Builder and its documentation are still undergoing
    extensive development. We will announce when Data Builder is ready
    for general use on the [Platform News](https://www.opensafely.org/changelog/) page.
