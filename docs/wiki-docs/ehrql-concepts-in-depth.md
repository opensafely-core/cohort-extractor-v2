# ehrQL concepts in depth

This page explains several important concepts that you should understand
in order to write a dataset definition.
It builds on the [introduction to ehrQL concepts](introduction-to-ehrql-concepts.md).

## An example dataset definition

Here is a very short dataset definition:

```python
from ehrql import Dataset
from ehrql.tables.beta.core import patients, medications

dataset = Dataset()

dataset.define_population(patients.date_of_birth.is_on_or_before("1999-12-31"))

asthma_codes = ["39113311000001107", "39113611000001102"]
latest_asthma_med = (
    medications.where(medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes))
    .sort_by(medications.date)
    .last_for_patient()
)

dataset.med_date = latest_asthma_med.date
dataset.med_code = latest_asthma_med.dmd_code
```

When this dataset definition is executed,
it generates a table of data containing rows only for patients born before the year 2000.
The table contains two columns:
`med_date` and `med_code`.

We will explain how the dataset definition works below.
Before that, we need to explain four important related types of object.

## Running in the sandbox

The explanations that follow make use of the [ehrQL sandbox](running-ehrql.md#sandbox-mode).

:spiral_notepad: You need to have already followed the steps in the [Installation and setup](installation-and-setup.md) page
to have the `opensafely` command installed and the example dummy data downloaded.

You can follow along by starting the sandbox:

    opensafely exec ehrql:v0 sandbox example-data

and importing the tables that we want to interact with:

    >>> from ehrql.tables.beta.core import patients, medications

:spiral_notepad: The outputs below are truncated.

## Core types of object

### Series

A series represents a column of data,
and there are two types: patient series and event series.
A series either represents a column in a backend table,
or some columnar data that has been derived by transforming one or more columns in one or more backend tables.

#### Patient series

A patient series represents a column of data where there is no more than one value per patient.

For instance, a patient series containing dates of birth might look like:

    >>> patients.date_of_birth
    0 | 1973-07-01
    1 | 1948-03-01
    2 | 2003-04-01
    3 | 2007-06-01
    ...

In this output, the left-hand column shows the patient ID.

#### Event series

An event series represents a column of data where there can be multiple values per patient.

For instance, an event series containing medications dates might look like:

    >>> medications.date
    0 | 0 | 2014-01-11
    1 | 1 | 2015-08-06
    1 | 2 | 2018-09-21
    1 | 3 | 2020-05-17
    3 | 4 | 2022-11-09
    ...

In this output, the left-hand column shows the patient ID
and the middle column shows the row number.

### Frames

A frame represents a table of data,
and contains one or more series.
A frame either represents a backend table,
or some tabular data that has been derived by transforming data from one or more backend tables.

#### Patient frames

A patient frame represents a table of data where there is no more than one row per patient.

For instance, a patient frame containing demographic data might look like:

    >>> patients
    patient_id        | date_of_birth     | sex               | date_of_death
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 1973-07-01        | female            | 2015-09-14
    1                 | 1948-03-01        | male              | None
    2                 | 2003-04-01        | male              | None
    3                 | 2007-06-01        | female            | None
    ...

#### Event frames

An event frame represents a table of data where there may be multiple rows per patient.

For instance, an event frame containing medication data might look like:

    >>> medications
    patient_id        | row_id            | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 1                 | 2015-08-06        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 2                 | 2018-09-21        | 39113311000001107
    1                 | 3                 | 2020-05-17        | 22777311000001105
    3                 | 4                 | 2022-11-09        | 22777311000001105
    ...


### Datasets

A dataset is a table containing **one row per patient**,
and **one column per feature of interest**.

The challenge is to **transform** the tables in an OpenSAFELY backend
(which are all either event frames or patient frames)
into one or more patient series that we can then add to a dataset definition.

## Transformations

### Transforming a frame into a series

Transforming an event frame or a patient frame into an event series or a patient series requires one step:
we select the column using Pythonâ€™s attribute lookup notation.

We can transform the `patients` patient frame into a patient series like this:

    >>> patients.date_of_birth
    0 | 1973-07-01
    1 | 1948-03-01
    2 | 2003-04-01
    3 | 2007-06-01
    ...

### Transforming an event frame into a patient frame

Transforming an event frame into a patient frame involves selecting one row per patient.
We do this in two steps:

1. Choose one or more columns of the event frame to sort on.
2. Pick either the first or last row for each patient.

We can transform the `medications` event frame into a patient frame
containing just the earliest medication for each patient like this:

    >>> medications.sort_by(medications.date).first_for_patient()
    patient_id        | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 2015-08-06        | 39113611000001102
    3                 | 2022-11-09        | 22777311000001105
    ...


### Transforming an event frame into another event frame

An event frame can also be transformed into another event frame
by filtering for rows that do or do not match a given condition.

We can transform the `medications` event frame into another event frame
containing just the rows for 100mcg/dose Salbutamol like this:

    >>> medications.where(medications.dmd_code == "39113611000001102")
    patient_id        | row_id            | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 1                 | 2015-08-06        | 39113611000001102
    ...


Alternatively we can transform the `medications` event frame into another event frame
containing all rows except the rows for 100mcg/dose Salbutamol like this:

    >>> medications.except_where(medications.dmd_code == "39113611000001102")
    patient_id        | row_id            | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    1                 | 2                 | 2018-09-21        | 39113311000001107
    1                 | 3                 | 2020-05-17        | 22777311000001105
    3                 | 4                 | 2022-11-09        | 22777311000001105
    ...

### Transforming one series into another

Finally, there are many ways a series can be transformed to produce another series.
We describe some of the most important and useful ways here.

#### Filtering an event frame for rows matching a condition

To filter an event frame for rows that match a given condition,
we need an event series with Boolean values.

We can do this by querying whether an event's code is in a list of codes:

    >>> medications.dmd_code.is_in(["39113311000001107", "39113611000001102"])
    0 | 0 | True
    1 | 1 | True
    1 | 2 | True
    1 | 3 | False
    3 | 4 | False
    ...

Or we can do this by querying whether an event's date is before/after another date:

    >>> medications.date.is_on_or_after("2020-01-01")
    0 | 0 | False
    1 | 1 | False
    1 | 2 | False
    1 | 3 | True
    3 | 4 | True
    ...

#### Extracting dates

Given a series of dates, we can extract the year (or month or day):

    >>> medications.date.year
    0 | 0 | 2014
    1 | 1 | 2015
    1 | 2 | 2018
    1 | 3 | 2020
    3 | 4 | 2022

And we can perform arithmetic with dates:

    >>> from ehrql import days
    >>> medications.date + days(30)
    0 | 0 | 2014-02-10
    1 | 1 | 2015-09-05
    1 | 2 | 2018-10-21
    1 | 3 | 2020-06-16
    3 | 4 | 2022-12-09
    ...

## Explaining the example

We're now in a position to explain our example dataset definition.

To begin with, we import the Python objects that we'll need.

```python
from ehrql import Dataset
from ehrql.tables.beta.core import patients, medications
```

Next, we create a dataset object.
Don't worry about exactly what this line does!

```python
dataset = Dataset()
```

Now, we define the population of our dataset.

```python
dataset.define_population(patients.date_of_birth.is_on_or_before("1999-12-31"))
```

This can be broken down.

    >>> patients.date_of_birth
    0 | 1973-07-01
    1 | 1948-03-01
    2 | 2003-04-01
    3 | 2007-06-01
    4 | 1938-10-01
    5 | 1994-04-01
    6 | 1953-05-01
    7 | 1992-08-01
    8 | 1931-10-01
    9 | 1979-04-01
    >>> patients.date_of_birth.is_on_or_before("1999-12-31")
    0 | True
    1 | True
    2 | False
    3 | False
    4 | True
    5 | True
    6 | True
    7 | True
    8 | True
    9 | True

`dataset.define_population(s)` tells ehrQL that our dataset's population is only
the patients whose value in the series `s` is `True`.
So in this case,
our dataset's population consists of all patients born before the year 2000.

We're interested in asthma medications,
so we want to filter the medications event frame to contain
only rows for asthma medications.
We then want details of just the latest asthma medication.
So we need to transform the `medications` event frame into another, filtered, event frame,
and then we need to transform this into a patient frame.

```python
asthma_codes = ["39113311000001107", "39113611000001102"]
latest_asthma_med = (
    medications.where(medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes))
    .sort_by(medications.date)
    .last_for_patient()
)
```

Again, this can be broken down.

    >>> medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes)
    0 | 0 | True
    1 | 1 | True
    1 | 2 | True
    1 | 3 | False
    3 | 4 | False
    4 | 5 | True
    5 | 6 | False
    5 | 7 | True
    7 | 8 | False
    9 | 9 | False
    >>> medications.where(medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes))
    patient_id        | row_id            | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 1                 | 2015-08-06        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 2                 | 2018-09-21        | 39113311000001107
    4                 | 5                 | 2017-05-11        | 39113611000001102
    5                 | 7                 | 2019-07-06        | 39113611000001102
    >>> medications.where(medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes)).sort_by(medications.date)
    patient_id        | row_id            | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 1                 | 2015-08-06        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 2                 | 2018-09-21        | 39113311000001107
    4                 | 5                 | 2017-05-11        | 39113611000001102
    5                 | 7                 | 2019-07-06        | 39113611000001102
    >>> medications.where(medications.dmd_code.is_in(asthma_codes)).sort_by(medications.date).last_for_patient()
    patient_id        | date              | dmd_code
    ------------------+-------------------+------------------
    0                 | 2014-01-11        | 39113611000001102
    1                 | 2018-09-21        | 39113311000001107
    4                 | 2017-05-11        | 39113611000001102
    5                 | 2019-07-06        | 39113611000001102


Finally, we can transform this patient frame into two patient series,
which we can then add to our dataset.

```python
dataset.asthma_med_date = latest_asthma_medication.date
dataset.asthma_med_code = latest_asthma_medication.code
```

:spiral_notepad: Notice how the ehrQL sandbox can be useful
when developing your ehrQL queries.
It can sometimes be quicker to try out ideas interactively via the sandbox first,
instead of repeatedly editing a dataset definition and re-running it.
