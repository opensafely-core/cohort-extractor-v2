# ehrQL Documentation

Welcome to the ehrQL documentation!

**ehrQL** is a Python-based query language for electronic health record (EHR) data.
It has been designed for use with the [OpenSAFELY platform](https://docs.opensafely.org).

This documentation is stored in this wiki
while it undergoes rapid revision.
We plan to eventually migrate this documentation to the [OpenSAFELY documentation site](https://docs.opensafely.org).

## Conventions

We use the following emoji in this documentation to indicate:

* :construction: *sections of the documentation
  or ehrQL features that still require further work*
* :computer: *steps that you should carry out on the computer
  that you are using for working with ehrQL*
* :notepad_spiral: *extra explanatory information*
* :warning: *important information*
* :grey_question: *questions for you to think about and try to answer*
* :fast_forward: *the next part of the documentation that we suggest that you read*

## How to use this documentation

:construction: These documents are a work in progress,
but there should be enough for new users to get started.

:notepad_spiral: If you have previously used cohort-extractor,
you may find the [Coming to ehrQL from cohort-extractor](guidance-for-existing-cohort-extractor-users.md) page useful.

The pages are designed to be read in order.
