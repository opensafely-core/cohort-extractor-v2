# ehrQL Documentation

Welcome to the ehrQL documentation!

**ehrQL** is a Python-based query language for electronic health record (EHR) data.
It has been designed for use with the [OpenSAFELY platform](https://docs.opensafely.org).

This documentation is stored in this wiki
while it undergoes rapid revision.
We plan to eventually migrate this documentation to the [OpenSAFELY documentation site](https://docs.opensafely.org).

We use the following emoji in this documentation to indicate:

* :construction: *sections of the documentation

* :spiral_notepad: *extra explanatory information*
* :warning: *important information*

## How to use this documentation

:construction: These documents are a work in progress,
but there should be enough for new users to get started.

:spiral_notepad: If you have previously used cohort-extractor,
you may find the [Coming to ehrQL from cohort-extractor](guidance-for-existing-cohort-extractor-users) page useful.

The pages are designed to be read in order.
