**ehrQL** is a Python-based query language for electronic health record (EHR) data.
It has been designed for use with the [OpenSAFELY platform](https://docs.opensafely.org).

## Conventions

We use the following emoji in the ehrQL documentation section to indicate:

* :construction: *sections of the documentation
  or ehrQL features that still require further work*
* :computer: *steps that you should carry out on the computer
  that you are using for working with ehrQL*
* :notepad_spiral: *extra explanatory information*
* :warning: *important information*
* :grey_question: *questions for you to think about and try to answer*
* :fast_forward: *the next part of the documentation that we suggest that you read*

## How to use this documentation

:construction: These documents are a work in progress,
but there should be enough for new users to get started.

:notepad_spiral: If you have previously used cohort-extractor,
you may find the [Coming to ehrQL from cohort-extractor](../introduction/guidance-for-existing-cohort-extractor-users.md) page useful.

The pages and sections are designed to be read in order.
The reference section is most useful to consult when actually writing ehrQL,
though you may find it useful to skim through to get a feel for how ehrQL works.
