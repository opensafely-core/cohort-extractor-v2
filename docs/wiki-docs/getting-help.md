# Getting help

If you are confused or stuck, muddled, addled, befuddled or bemused,
and cannot easily find what you are looking for in this documentation, then:

1. don't worry
2. _please ask for help!_

For now, you should ask for help in the `#ehrql-support` channel in Slack.

:construction: We're still working on ehrQL and its documentation:
**hearing from ehrQL users what you find trickier to do or understand will help us improve ehrQL**.

And in particular,
if you see a strange error message that's not documented in [our catalogue of common errors](ehrql-errors.md),
let us know.

In future, we plan to hold regular ehrQL help clinics for new users.
