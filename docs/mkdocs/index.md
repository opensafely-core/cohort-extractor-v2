!!! danger

    This content has not yet been reviewed by OpenSAFELY technical
    leads. This page is *not* a definitive statement about the status of
    Data Builder, cohort-extractor or any other part of OpenSAFELY.

    It should be taken as potentially incorrect, until this notice is
    removed.

## Data Builder constructs datasets for researchers

Data Builder is a tool to construct your dataset to use for research studies
and analysis using OpenSAFELY.

With Data Builder:

* **Researchers** can specify data they want to use in their research via a
  [*dataset definition*](dataset-definition.md).
* **Data providers** can specify data they want to offer for research
  via the [*OpenSAFELY Contracts*](contracts/index.md)
  specification and implementation.

## Features
### Readable dataset definitions

A new query language [ehrQL](ehrql/index.md) has been developed for
Data Builder. Researchers can now use a *dataset definition* to specify
the data to be extracted from OpenSAFELY.

ehrQL is designed to be semantically easy to
read and understand how the dataset it is defining is constructed.

### Multiple backends

Data Builder facilitates querying multiple different data backends,
without the researcher concerning themselves with the specific details
of how that backend works. This means that a researcher only need
to write a dataset definition once and be able to use this to
query different datasets.

### Researcher-provided dummy data
Data Builder allows researchers to provide their own dummy data to
use to develop their analytical code against.

!!! Note
There is work in progress to add the functionality to generate dummy data
from the dataset definition. This is currently in development.

## Why Data Builder was created
For researchers familiar with OpenSAFELY, there is naturally a question as
to why we are writing software to replace cohort extractor. Data Builder is
intended to eventually replace the use of cohort-extractor in new studies.
We have [more information](comparison-with-cohort-extractor.md) about the
differences between cohort-extractor and Data Builder to read if you are
interested.

In OpenSAFELY's first two years, researchers have used cohort-extractor
and study definitions to successfully complete a number of [research
studies](https://www.opensafely.org/research/) using [multiple data
sources and linked data](../data-sources/index.md).

Data Builder is a complete redesign and reimplementation of
cohort-extractor aimed at making OpenSAFELY even easier to work with for
researchers and data providers. Data Builder's design incorporates
feedback from researchers' use of cohort-extractor.

Data Builder:

* **Provides more expressive ways** for researchers to specify cohorts.
* **Integrates external data providers more easily** by introducing
  OpenSAFELY Contracts to provide specifications for data.
* **Simplifies the implementation of new features** across multiple
  different data backends.

For more information on how Data Builder and Cohort Extractor compare,
see [the development plan for Data Builder](comparison-with-cohort-extractor.md).

## Reading the Data Builder documentation
Other documentation pages explain in more detail the concepts to write a
dataset definition:

* Data Builder [quick start](quick-start.md)
* Writing a [dataset definition](dataset-definition.md)
* The [dataset definition language, ehrQL](ehrql/index.md)
* The [OpenSAFELY Contracts](contracts/index.md) that define what data
  is available from the various OpenSAFELY data backends.

## Data Builder is still in development

!!! warning

    There is considerable on-going work into Data Builder's
    design and development. Data Builder is subject to frequent change,
    indicated by its [current `v0` version](#versioning).

    We recommend that users still favour the existing [OpenSAFELY Cohort
    Extractor](../study-def.md) for their research.
