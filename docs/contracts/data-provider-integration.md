# Guidance for data providers integrating into OpenSAFELY

    This page is not yet complete.

    More complete guides on working with OpenSAFELY Contracts for
    external data providers will eventually be documented more fully here.

## Introduction

For a data provider to offer new data for OpenSAFELY, there are two
technical requirements:

1. The data being offered must satisfy [existing OpenSAFELY
   Contracts](data-provider-integration.md#implementing-existing-opensafely-contracts).
2. The data backend must have an [implementation in OpenSAFELY Data
   Builder](data-provider-integration.md#data-builder-integration-requirements).

## Implementing existing OpenSAFELY Contracts

An OpenSAFELY backend implements one or more of these specifications.
Each specification covers a specific healthcare data domain.

The structure of a Contract is explained in the [Contracts
introduction](index.md#the-structure-of-a-contract).

The [Contracts reference](reference.md) provides the existing
data specifications for both OpenSAFELY users and data providers.

Refer to those specifications when preparing data tables for integration
with OpenSAFELY.

### What if the available Contracts are unsuitable for a data provider?

Structuring data in line with OpenSAFELY Contracts makes it easier for
researchers using OpenSAFELY to run studies across multiple data
backends.

However, data providers may have:

* data in a considerably different structure from existing Contracts
* data not covered at all by existing Contracts

In these cases, a data provider could propose:

* amendments to existing OpenSAFELY Contracts, if appropriate.
* an entirely new OpenSAFELY Contract. This may involve the creation of
  a new Contract [namespaced](index.md#naming-contracts) to your
  organisation or backend.

!!! note
    We see the development of OpenSAFELY Contracts as an ongoing
    process. Each discussion that we have with data providers informs
    the design of the Contracts. We aim to continue to iterate and
    improve on the designs of Contracts, while providing stability
    through [versioning](index.md#versioning).

#### Proposing changes to OpenSAFELY Contracts

!!! note
    OpenSAFELY Contracts are still in an initial design and
    implementation phase. We already have designs for additional
    Contracts that will be implemented in future.

If no existing Contract corresponds to the healthcare data domain that
your data covers, [please contact our technical team to discuss how we
can help](../../how-to-get-help.md#data-providers).

## Integrating a data backend into OpenSAFELY Data Builder

[OpenSAFELY Data Builder](../index.md) is the software
component that researchers use to extract datasets of interest from
healthcare data providers in OpenSAFELY. Data Builder is written in
Python.

Data Builder abstracts the details of writing queries for researchers
away. Researchers only need be concerned with specifying the data they
want, not how to access it.

### Data Builder integration requirements

Supporting a new backend in Data Builder has two requirements:

1. Data Builder must have a [query
   engine](https://github.com/opensafely-core/databuilder/tree/main/databuilder/query_engines)
   compatible with the backend.
2. Data Builder must have code [describing how tables in the backend
   satisfy the supported OpenSAFELY
   Contracts](https://github.com/opensafely-core/databuilder/tree/main/databuilder/backends).

!!! note
    Currently, Data Builder has the following query engines:

    * Microsoft SQL Server
    * Apache Spark.

    Support for another data store will require adding a new query
    engine.

If you are a new data provider, [please contact our technical team to
discuss integration with Data Builder and
OpenSAFELY](../../how-to-get-help.md#data-providers).
