## Navigating the documentation

The Introduction, Tutorial and Explanation sections are written to be read in order.
You can navigate the pages in any of these following ways:

* Press the ++n++ or ++period++ key on your computer keyboard to go to the next page
  and the ++p++ or ++comma++ key to go to the previous page.
* Use the "Previous" and "Next" pages in the page footer on each page.
* Refer to the table of contents to the left of the page content,
  to see which page is next,
  and clicking a link to see that page.

The reference section is most useful to consult when actually writing ehrQL,
though you may find it useful to skim through to get a feel for how ehrQL works.

## Conventions

We use the following emoji in the ehrQL documentation section to indicate:

* :construction: *sections of the documentation
  or ehrQL features that still require further work*
* :computer: *steps that you should carry out on the computer
  that you are using for working with ehrQL*
* :notepad_spiral: *extra explanatory information*
* :warning: *important information*
* :grey_question: *questions for you to think about and try to answer*
