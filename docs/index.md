*ehrQL* (*err-kul*), the **Electronic Health Records Query Language**,
is a programming language and command line interface designed for the specific application domain of EHR data.
Researchers create **dataset definitions** with the programming language
and execute them with the command line interface to generate **one row per patient datasets**.

ehrQL allows researchers to access data sources from primary and secondary care,
as well as from organisations such as the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

## ehrQL's documentation

We suggest that you first read through the introduction section in order,
starting with ["Using this documentation"](introduction/using-this-documentation.md)

The introduction will give you more information about ehrQL
and this documentation.

ehrQL's documentation has four main sections:

1. The [tutorial](tutorial/index.md) provides practical steps for studying ehrQL.

1. The [how-to guides](how-to/index.md) provide practical steps for working with ehrQL in your project.

1. The [reference](reference/index.md) provides theoretical knowledge for working with ehrQL in your project.

1. The [explanation](explanation/index.md) provides theoretical knowledge for studying ehrQL.

### Conventions

* :computer: steps you should follow on the computer you are using for studying or working with ehrQL
* :notepad_spiral: explanatory information
* :warning: important information
* :grey_question: questions for you to think about

### Navigation

The four main sections are written to be read in order.
You can navigate between them by:

* pressing the ++n++ or ++period++ keys to go to the next page, and the ++p++ or ++comma++ keys to go to the previous page;
* using the *Previous* and *Next* links in the page footer;
* referring to the navigation pane to the left of the page and clicking a link.

## ehrQL replaces cohort-extractor

Whilst cohort-extractor will be supported for projects created before June 2023,
new projects should use ehrQL.
Please [get in touch with us before you start using ehrQL](introduction/getting-help.md)
and we can help you get started.
For more information,
read the [guidance for existing cohort-extractor users](introduction/guidance-for-existing-cohort-extractor-users.md).
