*ehrQL* (*err-kul*), the **Electronic Health Records Query Language**,
is a programming language and command line interface designed for the specific application domain of EHR data.
Researchers create **dataset definitions** with the programming language
and execute them with the command line interface to generate **one row per patient datasets**.

ehrQL allows researchers to access data sources from primary and secondary care,
as well as from organisations such as the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

!!! info

    ehrQL is a replacement for OpenSAFELY's cohort-extractor.

    cohort-extractor will continue to work
    and be supported for OpenSAFELY projects
    created before June 2023.

    However, *new* projects should use ehrQL to query data available in OpenSAFELY.
    Please [get in touch with us before you start using ehrQL](introduction/getting-help.md)
    and we can help you get started.

    For more details,
    read our [explanation on what this change means](introduction/guidance-for-existing-cohort-extractor-users.md)
    for existing cohort-extractor users.

## How to start learning ehrQL

We suggest that you first read through the introduction section in order,
starting with ["Using this documentation"](introduction/using-this-documentation.md)

The introduction will give you more information about ehrQL
and this documentation.

ehrQL's documentation has four main sections:

1. The [tutorial](tutorial/index.md) provides practical steps for studying ehrQL.

1. The [how-to guides](how-to/index.md) provide practical steps for working with ehrQL in your project.

1. The [reference](reference/index.md) provides theoretical knowledge for working with ehrQL in your project.

1. The [explanation](explanation/index.md) provides theoretical knowledge for studying ehrQL.
