# Note that the INTERVAL_START_DATE/INTERVAL_END_DATE values are ehrQL parameters (or
# placeholders). From the point of view of the rest of ehrQL they are just
# `DatePatientSeries` instances like any other. But they have no date associated with
# them and so can't be executed until we substitue in a concrete date value.
#
# We're using a start/end pair rather than a single INDEX_DATE so we don't have to
# hardcode the interval duration into the definition.
#
# I used uppercase for these names as they are, technically, constants. But I'm open to
# the accusation that this is all a bit Java and it would be more readable if they were
# lowercase.
